"""This directory holds the package's recipe: its manifest.

The recipe is what *Use in an application* in the README lists, written as
data: the bundle to list, the worker to run, and the steps only a person can
take — a task and the schedule it joins are application code. An application
applies it with ``xtr-recipes recipes:sync``, which finds this module through
the ``xtr_recipes`` entry point.

Nothing is importable from here. The manifest is read as a file, so a recipe
is the same from a wheel as from a working tree.
